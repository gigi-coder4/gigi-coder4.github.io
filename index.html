     <p style="color: white;">
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
      String Instruments:
Traditional Korean string instruments are made of paulownia wood and some other materials. They are categorized on the basis of the basic technique used to produce the sounds, such as plucking, pulling, or hitting. For example, the gayageum and geomungo mainly produce sounds when the strings are plucked. On the other hand, the ajaeng produces sounds when the strings are pulled with a bow. The yanggeum makes sounds when the metal strings are hit with a stick.  
      <br>
      <br>
      Wind Instruments:
Most of Korean wind instruments are made of bamboo. They are classified differently based on the musicians' posture and the direction the instruments are facing. The piri, danso, taepyeongso are vertical instruments, while the daegeum and sogeum are transverse flutes. 
      <br>
      <br>
  
      Percussions:
Korean percussive instruments are made of metal, animal skin, wood, bamboo, and stone. They are also divided into two kinds, one with different pitches and the other without pitches. The pyeonjong and the pyeonggyeong are the most popularly shown melodic percussive instruments, while the bak, jwago, janggu, kkwenggwari, jing and buk have no pitches.

      The Siberian tiger is a population of the tiger subspecies Panthera tigris tigris native to the Russian Far East, Northeast China and possibly North Korea. It once ranged throughout the Korean Peninsula. It is also the national animal of South Korea.

      The Water Deer, often called the “vampire deer” due to its prominent fangs, is a unique and captivating member of the deer family. Native to East Asia, these small, secretive deer have some truly extraordinary features that set them apart from their relatives.
      <br> <br>
      The Lynx is another native cat to South Korea, like a tiger but much smaller. This solitary cat has a coat cover with beautiful sand brown with dark brown spots, and thick fur. The fur is a barrier against harsh temperatures and keeps them warm during frosty winters. 
      <br> <br>
       The history of South Korea begins with the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945.
      <br> <br>
      The Korean flag is called taegeukgi (pronounced teh-GUK-key). The colors of the flag are red, blue, and black on a white background. The flag stands for the three components of a nation: the land (the white background), the people (the red and blue circle), and the government (the four sets of black bars or trigrams). It was created in 1882 but the symbols are among the oldest found on any nation's flag.
